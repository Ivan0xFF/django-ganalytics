## Purpose

Honestly, all the other Google Analytics Django apps suck. All I want to do is
put my Google Analytics code in my ``settings.py`` file, and use a simple
template tag to render the Google Analytics asynchronous javascript code,
damnet!

Unfortunately, all the existing solutions don't do this, and that pisses me
off!
